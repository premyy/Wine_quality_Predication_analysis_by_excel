# Wine_quality_Predication_analysis_by_excel

# üìù Description
This is a Predication Model Project Where I Predict the Quality of Wine based On 11 Physiochemical Indicators, I made this project in Excel.

# üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
Excel | Google Sheets

# ‚öôÔ∏è Setup
As I mentioned I made this Project by using Excel So there are many Tabs in this Excel sheet.
## Tabs With Operation
1) Introduction: Introduction Tabs Contain all the Information about this Test like Evaluation Matrix.
2) Data: Data Tabs Contain different-2 values of 11 Physiochemical Indicators Values and Wine Quality Values.
3) Model Data Description: These Tabs contain information about input and output Columns.
4) Correlation: in this tab, I found the Correlation of values and I also used Conditional Formatting for Colouring the Cells.
5) Analysis: In this tab, I normalized 11 physiochemical indicator values by using [max-x]/[max-min] or [x-min]/[max-min] Formulas.
6) Control: in the control tab, I extract the correlation value with Quality from the Correlation Tab by using the Vlookup formula and also find out the top 5 Indicators on which Wine Quality Depends.
7) Scoring & assessment: in this tab, I found out the weighted sum of the top 5 Indicators After that I also predict Quality Value and found absolute and Square of absolute value.
8) Model Summary: in this tab, I found MSE(mean square error) value and also the Accuracy value, and predication value vs actual value.
9) interpretation of result: these tabs responsible for the final result mean what's the minimum/maximum/medium value for getting the wine quality value 6 or above 6.
